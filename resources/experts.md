## How to pick

- **General / unspecified domain** → `general-expert`
- **Specific domain mentioned** → match the domain column
- **Asked for a deliverable beyond a report** → `app-builder` (slidedeck/spreadsheet/HTML app) or `media-producer` (podcast/video)
- **Multiple domains touched** → pick the one most central to the user's intent; the chosen expert can still call cross-domain tools

## How to verify (drift check)

```bash
curl -s https://api.grep.ai/api/v2/experts | jq -r '.[].id' | sort > /tmp/live.txt
grep -oP '^\| `\K[a-z0-9-]+(?=`)' resources/experts.md | sort -u > /tmp/local.txt
diff /tmp/live.txt /tmp/local.txt
# No output = in sync. Output = drift; regenerate this file.
```
